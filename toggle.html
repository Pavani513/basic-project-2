        Career beginnings and struggle (2008–2010)
        As an undergraduate, Nani got addicted to movies, citing Mani Ratnam as a major influence.[8] He wanted to become a director; however, producer Anil Kumar Koneru allowed him to work on his production, Radha Gopalam (2005), as a "clap director", alongside director Bapu.[8] He then worked for films including Allari Bullodu (2005), Astram (2006), and Dhee (2007). Nani took a break, to work on a film script. Bhargavi Mallela, a friend of his, who was then working as a RJ for World Space Satellite, offered Nani work as an RJ.[8] He accepted the offer and worked there for one year, hosting a program named "Non-Stop Nani".[14][15]
        
        Director Mohan Krishna Indraganti noticed Nani in an advertisement and offered him a role in the aforementioned film Ashta Chamma, also starring Swati Reddy.[8] Ashta Chamma was well received by critics and Nani's performance was praised by them. Sify.com wrote "Nani has a very good screen presence. He has good emotions and dances well, though his body language sometimes reminds of Subhalekha Sudhakar – May this be treated as a compliment to the ease that the veteran actor shows on the screen! His addiction is good too."[16][17] His second film, Ride, was produced by Bellamkonda Suresh, with Tanish, Swetha Basu Prasad and Aksha Pardasany playing important roles. Ride was also a notable success at the box office.[18] He next starred in Satyam Bellamkonda's film Snehituda... opposite Maadhavi Latha.
